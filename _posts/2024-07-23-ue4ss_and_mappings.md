With the Unreal Engine upgrade to 5.3, you will now need a Mappings.usmap for UAssetGUI and Fmodel to fully function.  
You can download a shared version of the Mappings.usmap for Ready Or Not below:

## UAssetGUI Import
>Ensure UAssetGUI is updated for UE5.3 (Versions 1.0.1.0+)  

1. Open `Utils > Import mappings...`

## UE4SS

### Install

1. Download `UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip` from [Github UE4SS Releases](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases/)  
2. Extract the contents next to the `ReadyOrNot-Win64-Shipping.exe` in  
`...\Ready Or Not\ReadyOrNot\Binaries\Win64\`

### Generating Mappings

How to create a new `Mappings.usmap`

1. Open `UE4SS-settings.ini` and change the following:
```ini
MajorVersion = 5
MinorVersion = 3
ConsoleEnabled = 1
GuiConsoleEnabled = 1
GuiConsoleVisible = 1
GraphicsAPI = dx11
```

2. Start the game, wait to load to menu, switch to the UE4SS window.  
	> If the game crashes after Epic Online Services says connected/offline, you may need to start the game with your pc disconnected from a network.  
	{: .prompt-warning }
3. Under the `Dumpers` tab press `Generate .usmap file.....`
4. It should work instantly, but you can confirm on the `Console` tab.  
The file `Mappings.usmap` should be create next to your .exe  
5. You can close the game now.  
	>If you want to disable UE4SS you can rename dwmapi.dll or remove it's files.  
	>Otherwise it's quite handy for enabling the in game console, you may just want to hide the GUI window if your not using it  
	>```ini
	GuiConsoleVisible = 0
	```
