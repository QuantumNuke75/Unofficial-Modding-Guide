## Sound Modding

**Voiceover Modding**  
Voice over modding is incredibly easy. Simply navigate to `…/Ready Or Not/ReadyOrNot/Content/VO/…` and replace any lines you wish to replace.

**FMOD Modding**
1. Extract an FMOD Bank with FMOD Bank Tool from `.../Ready Or Not/ReadyOrNot/Content/FMOD/Desktop/…`.
2. Edit or replace any sounds you wish. Make sure the file you are replacing with is the same format as the original file.
3. Using FMOD Bank Tools, repack all the files and replace the FMOD Bank within the game files.
