### FAQ

```markdown
**Q: How do I install/uninstall mods?**
A: Navigate to your Ready or Not install directory and go to `…/ReadyOrNot/Content/Paks/…` and drag in any .pak mods which you wish to install. If you want to uninstall, simply delete the mods from that directory.

**Q: Can I still play online with mods?**
A: Yes, although if you use a map mod and they do not have that same mod, you will run into issues, whether you are hosting or not. 

**Q: Can other people see my mods?**
A: No, unless they also have that mod installed.

**Q: Will I get banned for using mods?**
A: No, unless you cheat via other means. Mods are encouraged by the developers.

**Q: Where can I find mods?**
A: NexusMods. Any other website is not safe and harms creators. 

**Q: Should I start modding?**
A: Probably not. The official SDK might come out in 6 months, and that’s the best bet for modding. As for the moment, modding is a pain, and unless you really want to, you probably shouldn’t.
