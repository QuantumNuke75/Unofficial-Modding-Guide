## FAQ

**Q: How do I install/uninstall mods?**  
Navigate to your Ready or Not install directory and go to `…/ReadyOrNot/Content/Paks/…` and drag in any .pak mods which you wish to install. If you want to uninstall, simply delete the mods from that directory.

**Q: Can I still play online with mods?**  
Yes, although you'll need to disable `Server Side Checksum` in settings in order to join or host modded lobbies. 

**Q: Can other people see my mods?**  
Most most are not visible to other players unless they also have the mod installed. 

**Q: Will I get banned for using mods?**  
No, unless you cheat via other means. Mods are supported by the developers.

**Q: Where can I find mods?**  
NexusMods is the recommended place to find mods. Any other website may not be safe and can harm the creators of the mod.

**Q: Should I start modding?**  
Probably not. The official SDK might come out in 3-6 months, and that’s the best bet for modding. As for the moment, modding is a pain compared to when the SDK comes out, and unless you really want to, you probably shouldn’t.
